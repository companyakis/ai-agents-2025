To explain what an Agent is, let’s start with an analogy.

# The Big Picture: Alfred The Agent

Meet Alfred. Alfred is an Agent.

Imagine Alfred receives a command, such as: “Alfred, I would like a coffee please.”

Because Alfred "understands natural language", he quickly grasps our request.

Before fulfilling the order, Alfred engages in "reasoning and planning", figuring out the steps and tools he needs to:

1 Go to the kitchen

2 Use the coffee machine

3 Brew the coffee

4 Bring the coffee back

Once he has a plan, he must act. To execute his plan, he can use tools from the list of tools he knows about.

And this is what an Agent is: an AI model capable of reasoning, planning, and interacting with its environment.
